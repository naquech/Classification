    "The Census Income is a popular data set used for classification in Machine Learning; it's used to classify a person's income in two groups based on census data. The groups are people who earn more than 50,000/year, and those who earn less than 50,000/year. The data set contains 14 attributes and 48,842 instances.\n",
